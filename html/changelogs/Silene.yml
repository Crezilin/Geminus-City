changes: 
  - wip: "Starting work on new whitelist-based structure for public sector jobs. In the future, people will need to work as Cadets/Interns for a time to learn the ropes and prove themselves before being allowed access to more dangerous/complicated jobs. The new structure does NOT apply to private sector jobs- it's assumed that CEOs/managers there will regulate their own staff."
  - rscadd: "New job: Police Cadet. Split off from Police Officer, was formerly an alt-title. Same ID access as a Police Officer, but half the pay."
